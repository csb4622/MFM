# MFM
A NET model inspired by the Movalble Feast Machine by Dave Ackley.  This is not meant to be a port of his work, but rather a simplified derivative made to gain a better understanding of his lectures.

For more information, you can read the wiki [here](http://robust.cs.unm.edu/doku.php?id=start), or watch his youtube channels [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/DaveAckley) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/@T2TileProject).  Or vist the T2 Tile project [here](https://t2tile.com/).
